        <div  class="editable">
          <p>There are many reasons people refinance their mortgage but the most common ones are to save money on their monthly bill or over the life of their loan. However, some people also take advantage of refinancing to shorten the length of their mortgage or get some of their equity out of their homes to cover other expenses.</p>
          <p>Regardless of why you’re thinking about refinancing, it’s important to weigh all your options and come up with a strategy that makes sense for your personal financial goals.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
        <h3 class="m-t-3">How often can I refinance my home?</h3>
        <p>Limitations on refinancing can vary from state to state so you’ll want to check the regulations for the specific state where the property is located. The other thing to ask about is early payoff fees., which are different from prepayment penalties.  While prepayment fees are meant to prevent you from paying off additional principle, an early payoff fee is a fee paid to the originating lender for loans that have only been on a books a few months. Your loan officer can tell you which types of loans carry these kinds of restrictions.</p>
        
        <h3>How much does it cost to refinance?</h3>
        <p>There are many options for managing closing costs for different kinds of refinance loans. Regardless of whether or not you receive closing credits from your lender, you often have the option of folding closing costs into your loan to avoid having to put up cash at closing. You may hear that 1.5% of your loan amount is a good rule of thumb for closing costs but it is always best to ask your loan officer about all your options.</p>
        <p>PennyMac also offers a <a href="https://www.pennymacusa.com/refinancing/refinancing-calculators">refinance calculator</a> to see if refinancing your home can help you lower your monthly payment or consolidate your debt. This is a great place to start as you weigh costs against benefits.</p>

        <h3>How long does it take to refinance a mortgage?</h3>
        <p>Many refinance loans can take 30-45 days to close but there are lots of exceptions if your finances are complex or you’re refinancing at a particularly busy time of year.</p>
        <p>There are, however, steps you can take to limit your exposure to delays. Much of the documentation that you’ll need to provide for processing can be determined as soon as you know what kind of loan you will be applying for. Collecting and scanning documents like tax returns and income verification is a good start and can save you crucial days of your application process.</p>
        
        <h3>What is equity? Why is it important for refinancing?</h3>
        <p>Equity is the appraised value of your home minus the amount you still owe on your loan. This is an important factor for refinance loans that require a minimum loan-to-value (LTV) percentage and for <a href="https://www.pennymacusa.com/refinancing-products/cash-out-refinance">cash out refinances</a> where you want to take a specific amount of cash out of your existing equity.</p>
        <p>If you’re interested in estimating the current equity in your home, PennyMac has created a <a href="https://www.pennymacusa.com/home-value-estimator">Home Value Estimator</a> to help. To determine your estimated equity, just subtract the outstanding balance of your loan from the estimated value of your property and you will have a great starting point for determining what types of refinance loans would work for you.</p>

        <h3>What documents are required to refinance?</h3>
        <p>Your documentation is what shows our underwriters that you’re a good fit for the loan you’ve selected. Here is a list of some of the most <a href="https://www.pennymacusa.com/blog/a-refinance-checklist-do-you-have-all-the-right-documents">common documents</a> that your loan officer may ask for:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Proof of income:</dt>
          <dd>You will generally be asked to provide pay stubs for the past 30 days in order to provide income verification. Self-employed borrowers may be asked for different documentation.</dd>
          <dt>Copy of homeowners insurance:</dt>
          <dd>Verifying that your property is insured, or will be insured, is important to all lenders.</dd>
          <dt>Copies of your W-2 forms:</dt>
          <dd>Providing your W-2 forms will give your lender a much broader picture of your financial picture.</dd>
          <dt>Copies of asset information:</dt>
          <dd>Lenders are required to verify that you have the funds available to cover various expenses of the loan. You may be asked for statements for accounts that hold money for closing costs, statements for savings, statements for checking and 401(k) accounts and investment records for mutual funds or stocks.</dd>
          <dt>Copy of title insurance:</dt>
          <dd>A copy of your title insurance is important to help your lender verify your taxes, names on the title and the legal description of the property.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Your lender will also need to pull your credit report as a part of the refinance process, so have your Social Security number handy when it’s time to apply.</p>

          <h3>Will a refinance help get rid of my PMI?</h3>
        <p>In many cases, yes. As rates have dropped and home value have risen, many homeowners have an opportunity to remove their PMI while reducing their overall monthly payment. Talk to your loan officer about the specific requirements of the loan products that you qualify for.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that many loans have a "seasoning requirement" that requires you to wait at least 2 years before you can <a href="https://www.pennymacusa.com/blog/the-facts-about-mortgage-insurance">refinance to get rid of PMI</a>. So if your loan is less than 2 years old, you can request that your PMI be removed with a new refinance but you're not guaranteed to get approval.</p>
        
        <h3>What refi options are available to me if I have bad credit?</h3>
        <p>There are many loan types that cater to borrowers with sub-optimal credit. The best way to find out about all your options is to let a loan officer pull your credit and explain the benefits of different programs to you.</p>

        <h3>What is Streamline Refinance?</h3>
        <p>Streamline refinancing was created to expedite the process of obtaining a new loan by referencing existing paperwork and data on a borrower. The process is no only faster but also easier on the borrower since it eliminates the need to provide full documentation, like you would for a standard conventional loan.</p>
        <p>Opting for a streamline refinance can be a viable option for borrowers who want a lower interest rate or need to transition from an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) to a fixed-rate loan. Both the FHA and VA offer beneficial streamline refinancing programs to qualifying borrowers.</p>
